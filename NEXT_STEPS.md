## ðŸš€ What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new **public** repository named `contact-list-app`
3. **Important**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
4. Copy the repository URL

### 2. Push Your Code to GitHub (2 minutes)

Run these commands in the `contact-list-app` directory:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/contact-list-app.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

**Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)**

1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in (or create account)
2. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
3. Click "Import" next to your `contact-list-app` repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect settings:
   - Framework: Vite âœ“
   - Build Command: `npm run build` âœ“
   - Output Directory: `dist` âœ“
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
7. Your app will be live! ðŸŽ‰

**Option B: Via Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Update README with Live URL (1 minute)

After deployment:

1. Copy your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://contact-list-app.vercel.app`)
2. Open `README.md`
3. Replace `[Coming Soon - Deployment URL will be added here]` with your actual URL
4. Commit and push:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add live deployment URL"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the updated README.
