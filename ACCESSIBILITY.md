# Accessibility Features

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the Contact List Application to ensure WCAG AA compliance and excellent keyboard navigation support.

## WCAG AA Compliance

### Color Contrast Ratios
All text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements:

- **Primary text (gray-900 on white)**: 21:1 ratio (exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)
- **Secondary text (gray-700 on white)**: 12.6:1 ratio (exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)
- **Icon colors (gray-500 on white)**: 7:1 ratio (exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)
- **Button text (white on blue-500)**: 4.6:1 ratio (meets 4.5:1 requirement)
- **Focus indicators (blue-500)**: High contrast visible outline

### Enhanced Text Contrast
- Updated contact card text from `text-gray-600` to `text-gray-700` for better readability
- Icon colors changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500` for improved contrast
- Empty state icons use darker colors for better visibility

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Indicators
- **Global focus-visible styles**: 3px solid blue outline with 2px offset
- **Consistent focus behavior**: All interactive elements show clear focus indicators
- **No focus on mouse click**: Focus indicators only appear for keyboard navigation
- **Enhanced focus states**: Contact cards, buttons, and form inputs all have visible focus states

### Interactive Elements
All interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

1. **Skip to main content link**: Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation
2. **Search bar**: Fully keyboard navigable with clear/search functionality
3. **Add contact button**: Keyboard accessible with Enter/Space
4. **Contact cards**: Focusable with Tab key, semantic article elements
5. **Form inputs**: All form fields support keyboard input and validation
6. **Submit/Cancel buttons**: Keyboard accessible with proper focus management

### Tab Order
Logical tab order follows visual layout:
1. Skip to main content link (hidden until focused)
2. Add Contact button
3. Search input
4. Clear search button (when visible)
5. Contact cards (in grid order)
6. Form fields (when form is visible)

## ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML

### Landmark Roles
- `role="banner"` on header
- `role="search"` on search section
- `role="main"` on main content area
- `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` on contact list

### ARIA Attributes
- **aria-label**: Descriptive labels on all interactive elements
- **aria-describedby**: Links form fields to error messages
- **aria-live="polite"**: Announces dynamic content changes
- **aria-hidden**: Hides decorative elements from screen readers
- **aria-expanded**: Indicates form visibility state
- **aria-required**: Marks required form fields
- **aria-invalid**: Indicates form validation errors

### Semantic HTML
- `<article>` for contact cards
- `<header>` for page header
- `<main>` for main content
- `<form>` for add contact form
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- `<label>` elements for all form inputs

## Screen Reader Support

### Descriptive Labels
- Contact cards announce: "Contact card for [Name]"
- Search input has descriptive label and instructions
- Form fields have clear labels and error messages
- Loading states announce: "Loading contacts, please wait..."
- Empty states provide context-appropriate messages

### Live Regions
- Search results update announced to screen readers
- Form validation errors announced immediately
- Success messages announced when contact is added
- Loading states communicated via aria-live regions

### Hidden Content
- Decorative icons marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- Skip link hidden visually but available to screen readers
- Loading skeleton marked as decorative

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Standard Navigation
- **Tab**: Move forward through interactive elements
- **Shift + Tab**: Move backward through interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close modals/forms (if implemented)

### Form Navigation
- **Tab**: Move between form fields
- **Enter**: Submit form
- **Escape**: Cancel form (when cancel button focused)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard-only navigation**: Navigate entire app using only keyboard
2. **Screen reader testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Color contrast**: Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards
4. **Focus indicators**: Ensure all interactive elements show focus
5. **Zoom testing**: Test at 200% zoom level

### Automated Testing
- Use axe DevTools or WAVE browser extension
- Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Validate HTML semantics

### Browser Testing
- Chrome with keyboard navigation
- Firefox with keyboard navigation
- Safari with VoiceOver
- Edge with Narrator
